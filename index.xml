      <description>Abstract: Septic shock is a life-threatening clinical condition characterized by a robust immune inflammatory response to disseminated infection. Little is known about its impact on the transcriptome of distinct human tissues. To address this, we performed RNA sequencing of samples from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, heart, lung, kidney and colon of seven individuals who succumbed to sepsis and seven uninfected controls. We identified that the lungs and colon were the most affected organs.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Free heme released from hemoglobin contributes to exacerbated inflammation and tissue damage in hemolytic diseases. While a moderate level of free heme does not cause intravascular inflammation by itself, its presence during infection greatly enhances inflammation. Although specific serum proteins have been found to affect heme-induced inflammation, the selective contribution of serum proteins inhibiting macrophage activation by heme or, conversely, amplifying the production of cytokines by macrophages stimulated with heme and microbial molecules, is poorly defined.</description>

      <description>Abstract: CD8 T cell differentiation is controlled by the crosstalk of various transcription factors and epigenetic modulators. Uncovering the different players in regulating this process is fundamental to improving immunotherapy and designing novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we show that Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)1 subunit Chromobox (Cbx)4 favors differentiation to effector CD8 T cells. Cbx4 deficiency in CD8 T cells induced transcriptional signature and phenotype of memory cells, increasing the formation of memory population during acute viral infection.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Individuals infected with Leishmania (L.) chagasi may present different asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of infection, which vary in the clinical–immunological profiles that can be classified as asymptomatic infection (AI), subclinical resistant infection (SRI), indeterminate initial infection (III), subclinical oligosymptomatic infection (SOI), and symptomatic infection (SI) (=American visceral leishmaniasis, AVL). However, little is known about the molecular differences between individuals having each profile. Here, we performed whole-blood transcriptomic analyses of 56 infected individuals from Pará State (Brazilian Amazon), covering all five profiles.</description>

      <description>Abstract: It is well established that infection with Leishmania alters the host cell’s transcriptome. Since mammalian cells have multiple mechanisms to control gene expression, different molecules, such as noncoding RNAs, can be involved in this process. MicroRNAs have been extensively studied upon Leishmania infection, but whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also altered in macrophages is still unexplored. We performed RNA-seq from THP-1-derived macrophages infected with Leishmania amazonensis (La), L. braziliensis (Lb), and L.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Pathogens can cause a wide variety of infectious diseases. The biological processes induced by the host in response to infection determine the severity of the disease. To study such processes, researchers can use high-throughput sequencing techniques (RNA-seq) that measure the dynamic changes of the host transcriptome at different stages of infection, clinical outcomes, or disease severity.This investigation can lead to a better understanding of the diseases, as well as uncovering potential drug targets and treatments.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Long-term immunological protection relies on the differentiation and maintenance of memory lymphocytes. Since the knowledge of memory generation has been centered on in vivo models of infection, there are obstacles to deep molecular analysis of differentiating subsets. Here we defined a novel in vitro CD8 T cell activation and culture regimen using low TCR engagement and cytokines to generate differentiated cells consistent with central memory-like cells, as shown by surface phenotype, gene expression profile and lack of cytotoxic function after challenge.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The progression and severity of COVID-19 vary significantly in the population. While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine laboratory parameters are emerging, the impact of sex and age on these profiles is still unknown. A multidimensional analysis was performed involving millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178 887 individuals from Brazil, of whom 33 266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Analyzed data included those relating to complete blood cell count, electrolytes, metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and others.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Huntington’s disease (HD) is a genetic disorder marked by transcriptional alterations that result in neuronal impairment and death. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation and fine-tuning of gene expression. Several studies identified altered miRNA expression in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases, however their roles in early stages of HD remain elusive. Here, we deep-sequenced miRNAs from the striatum of the HD mouse model, BACHD, at the age of 2 and 8 months, representing the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages of the disease.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of CD8+ T cell differentiation is critical for balancing pathogen eradication and long-term immunity by effector and memory CTLs, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that the lysine demethylase 6b (Kdm6b) is essential for the proper generation and function of effector CD8+ T cells during acute infection and tumor eradication. We found that cells lacking Kdm6b (by either T cell–specific knockout mice or knockdown using short hairpin RNA strategies) show an enhanced generation of memory precursor and early effector cells upon acute viral infection in a cell-intrinsic manner.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Patients who died from COVID-19 often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 to bind and enter host cells, no study has systematically assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples from patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients compared to control individuals.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Social distancing is an important measure to prevent the collapse of public health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries have managed to impose a strong control for social distancing, countries like Brazil largely depend on the population’s cooperation. Therefore, it is very necessary to monitor human mobility to detect whether social distancing policies are being implemented and to adjust them in places where the population is not adhering to these.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Transcriptome analyses have increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases. Most approaches aim to identify significant genes by comparing their expression values between healthy subjects and a group of patients with a certain disease. Given that studies normally contain few samples, the heterogeneity among individuals caused by environmental factors or undetected illnesses can impact gene expression analyses. We present a systematic analysis of sample heterogeneity in a variety of gene expression studies relating to inflammatory and infectious diseases and show that novel immunological insights may arise once heterogeneity is addressed.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The largest ever recorded epidemic of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) broke out in 2004 and affected four continents. Acute symptomatic infections are typically associated with the onset of fever and often debilitating polyarthralgia/polyarthritis. In this study, a systems biology approach was adopted to analyze the blood transcriptomes of adults acutely infected with the CHIKV. Gene signatures that were associated with viral RNA levels and the onset of symptoms were identified.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Dengue is a vector-borne disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV). Despite the crucial role of Aedes mosquitoes in DENV transmission, pure vector indices poorly correlate with human infections. Therefore there is great need for a better understanding of the spatial and temporal scales of DENV transmission between mosquitoes and humans. Here, we have systematically monitored the circulation of DENV in individual Aedes spp. mosquitoes and human patients from Caratinga, a dengue endemic city in the state of Minas Gerais, in Southeast Brazil.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Brucella abortus is a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium that causes a worldwide zoonosis termed brucellosis, which is characterized as a debilitating infection with serious clinical manifestations leading to severe complications. In spite of great advances in studies involving host–B. abortus interactions, there are many gaps related to B. abortus modulation of the host immune response through regulatory mechanisms. Here, we deep sequenced small RNAs from bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with B.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Social insects frequently engage in oral fluid exchange – trophallaxis – between adults, and between adults and larvae. Although trophallaxis is widely considered a food-sharing mechanism, we hypothesized that endogenous components of this fluid might underlie a novel means of chemical communication between colony members. Through protein and small-molecule mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we found that trophallactic fluid in the ant Camponotus floridanus contains a set of specific digestion- and non-digestion related proteins, as well as hydrocarbons, microRNAs, and a key developmental regulator, juvenile hormone.</description>

      <description>Abstract: MicroRNAs are small non-coding nucleotide sequences that regulate gene expression. These structures are fundamental to several biological processes, including cell proliferation, development, differentiation and apoptosis. Identifying the expression profile of microRNAs in healthy human gastric antrum mucosa may help elucidate the miRNA regulatory mechanisms of the human stomach. A small RNA library of stomach antrum tissue was sequenced using high-throughput SOLiD sequencing technology. The total read count for the gastric mucosa antrum region was greater than 618,000.</description>
